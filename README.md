# SentimentAnalysisApp
A Twitter sentiment analysis web application based on python and developed into a web application using streamlit. Public tweets are collected with the help of Twitter's own API v2. The user is required to indicate the hashtag and amount of tweets to analyse. A sentiment analysis will be conducted, resulting in the following features summarised in a summary:

1. Sentiment percentage: A percentage indicator showing how many tweets are classified as either positive, neutral, and negative.

2. N-gram diagram: The user specifies if the data is collected in either a unigram, bigram, or trigram. A grapg with the 5 most common words based on the n-gram will be shown.

3. Positive/Neutral/Negative wordcloud: A wordcloud with all the common vocabulary items is created based on its sentiment.
